# PABLO: WhatsApp Enhancement App

**Note: This project has been discontinued.**

This project aimed to enhance WhatsApp functionality using JavaScript and Node.js, leveraging the `whatsapp-web.js` module. It added various features to WhatsApp, such as integrating OpenAI API to access ChatGPT or DALL-E directly from WhatsApp messages, along with several custom features.

## Features

### OpenAI Integration
- Access ChatGPT or DALL-E directly from WhatsApp messages, providing users with AI-generated responses and images.

### Group Chat Summarization
- Summarize lengthy group chat messages for better readability and quick reference.

### Voice Notes to Text
- Convert voice notes received on WhatsApp to text for easier consumption and searchability.

### Text-Based Reminders
- Create reminders by sending free-written text messages, which are parsed through ChatGPT for improved context and understanding.

### Free APIs Integration
- Access free APIs like weather, stocks, and exchange rates directly from WhatsApp for quick information retrieval for specific purposes.

## Discontinuation
Due to the unofficial and unsupported nature of the `whatsapp-web.js` module, this project has been discontinued. The module lacks stability, making it challenging to build and maintain a reliable product on top of it, as it sporadically encounters issues when WhatsApp is updated. More info about the module can be found at https://wwebjs.dev/guide/.
